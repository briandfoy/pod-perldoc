	* Sync with the latest stuff in blead
	* Re-release as a CPAN module
	* brian d foy is taking over maintainer duties

2009-09-30
    * 3.15_01 - sync with blead

2008-11-01
    * no code changes from 3.14_07
    * summary of main changes:
          - perldoc -v PerlVar
          - old -v (Verbosely describe) is now -D
          - 'perldoc intro' will find 'perlintro' page
          - 'perldoc -L it' can find Italian translations
            of documentation (if you have them)

2008-05-08
    * Development release 3.14_07
    * Pod::Perldoc now has POD
    * so does Pod::Perldoc::BaseTo and Pod::Perldoc::GetOptsOO

2008-05-02
    * Development release 3.14_06 -- Be lenient
    * 'perldoc intro' may find 'perlintro' page
      (suggested by Gisle Aas)
    * -v (Verbosely describe) is now -D
    * perldoc -v PerlVar

2008-04-22
    * Development release 3.14_05 -- Search perlvar
    * Applied patch to allow -A for searching perlvar.
          (after a patch by Ovid, 2008-02-26)
          [rt.cpan.org #33624]

    * [RFC] the switch name is experimental: I am open
      to convincing alternatives (other than -v and -V
      which are already taken).

2008-04-16
    * Development release 3.14_04
    * 'lib' & co. are added to search path if -f Build.PL
      in current directory (rt.cpan.org #33941)
        * bug fix: 'blib' directories were never searched
      because they were tested with -f

2007-09-03
    * Development release 3.14_03
    * typo fix (#31763 by rgs)
    * warning and debugging code added to add_translator()
    * the translators now became objects
    * POD2::Base (if available) provides language-specific
      support for free
        * experimental releases, misses documentation of changes
    
2007-08-23
    * Development release 3.14_02
    * -L becomes more forgiving:
              $ perldoc -L it perldocpage
      retrieves the standard (English) version if it cannot find
      the Italian translation.
    * applied to bleed as Change #31762
    
2007-08-23
    * Release 3.14_01 -- bleedperl changes:
    + #31628: a Gentoo patch

    + #26191: new switch -L
    
2004-11-30  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org
    * Release 3.14 -- bugfix for Cygwin

    * Matt Johnson sends in two patches to accomodate Cygwin.
    Accepted.

    * Also changing pathsep for IS_MSWin32 || IS_Dos temp files
    from '/' to '\'.

2004-04-09  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org
    * Release 3.13 -- minor bugfixes

    Ken Willians notes that Pod::Perldoc::ToMan breaks when the
    pod2man program isn't in $Config{'scriptdirexp'}.  So I make it
    look there first, but then fall back to not specifying where it
    should be found.

    James Michael Du Pont notes that Carp::croak isn't always loaded
    by all versions of the modules perldoc uses.  So I add an explicit
    "require Carp::croak".

    I add t/01_about_verbose.t just to give more diagnostics.

2003-10-21  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org
    * Release 3.12 -- tweak for Linux man.
    
    Slaven Rezic notes that Makefile.PL should say INSTALLDIRS => "perl"
    for perl versions 5.8.1 and newer, to make installation work right
    on those perls.  Change made.

    Slaven Rezic notes that -q was generating an erroneous =over 8 ...
    around the sliced text from perlfaq searched via -q.  Change made
    -- this =over 8 ... =back stuff is now generated only if you're
    calling perldoc with -f (for perlfunc sections).
    
    
2003-10-12  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org
    * Release 3.11 -- tweak for Linux man.
    Brendan O'Dea provides code for Pod/Perldoc/ToMan.pm to sets -rLL
    to what stty reports for terminal column width.
    
    
2003-09-10  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org
    * Release 3.10 -- bugfix for cygwin
    Jari Aalto notes a problem with cygwin and the containspod routine
    -- cygwin apparently pretends there's an executable $filename file
    when there's really a "$filename.exe" file.  Added a
    cygwin-specific hack in containspod to trap this case.
    
    
2003-07-24  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org
    * Release 3.09.
    
    Notable changes:
    
    * perldoc when run as root no longer dies when it can't manage to
    drop privileges.  This is by popular demand.
    * perldoc -f -X now properly sees an -X entry regardless of
    whether it's coded as =item -X or =item I<-X>.
    * In README, changed "This is an experimental distribution of
    Perldoc," to "This is the distribution of Perldoc,"

    Wee little things:
    
    * Added a "use 5.006;" to the start of Perldoc.pm and the
    Makefile.PL, since we do actually need that version of perl
    for the module to even compile right.  (Altho backporting is an
    option later, if we remove the 5.6-isms.)
    * Perldoc.pm has a new constant IS_Cygwin if we ever need it.
    * Added a bit of IS_VMS logic.
    * Minor cosmetic changes to handling of -U.
    * Added a few comments here and there.
    
2003-01-18  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org
    * Release 3.08.
    * Fixed split-related bug in reading $Config{'pager'}.
    Thanks to Chip Turner <cturner@redhat.com> for pointing it out!

2002-12-01  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org
    * Release 3.07.
    * Minor typo fix to code in Pod::Perldoc::ToMan.
    * Added RTFREADER example to Pod::Perldoc::ToRTF docs.
    * Made Pod::Perldoc::ToTk a bit more tolerant of old Tk::Pod
    versions (pre-4.0). 

2002-11-22  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org
    * Release 3.06.
    * Made it install to perldoc pand perldoc.pod now.
    * Added -V
    * Made -U a no-op switch, for legacy.
    * Corrected a few minor typoes in the usage messages.
    * Updated perldoc.pod to document the switches that were
    previously documented only in perldoc -h
    
    * Many thanks to David Hand, Avi Finkel, Iain "Spoon" Truskett,
    Conrad Heiney, Casey West, Pete Sergeant, David Dyck, Michael
    Schwern, Slaven Rezic, Hugo van der Sanden, and many others for
    lots of patient help in working on this.
    
2002-11-11  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org
    * Release 3.05 alpha.
    * Corrected the logic that suppresses warnings during require's or
    formattings.

    * Corrected bug that ignored -T when using -m
    
2002-11-11  Sean M. Burke  sburke@cpan.org

    * Many new features, including the switches: -T, -d, -o, -M, -w
