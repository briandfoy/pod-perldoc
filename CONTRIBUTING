# Contributing to Pod::Perldoc

Pod::Perldoc is the module behind Perl's `perldoc` utility that comes
with `perl`. It's a "dual-lived" module, meaning that although it comes
with `perl`, it's development is not in the `perl5/perl` repo. Instead,
it's developed as a separate module and imported by the perl release manager
later.

## The Scope of perldoc

`perldoc` is a traffic cop. Given an input source, it chooses something
to parse the input. Whatever that handler does becomes the output.
None of these handlers are part of the Pod::Perldoc distribution, and
Pod::Perldoc does not control how they work or what they do.

One of `perldoc`'s major tasks is displaying documentation on the
console. As such, it uses various information and guesses to figure
out which translator is best for the situation. This means that what
you see in your environment may be different than what other people
see in theirs. As such, we have to be very careful that any changes we
make not only work for you, but work everywhere else too. This is not
an easy task, and it has driven many developers to tears.

In some cases, Pod::Perldoc tries to parse select Perl documentation
pages itself. For example, the `-f` switch looks in `perlfunc.pod` and
expects to see very particular formatting and structure. Some of this
structure is not what we might choose if we had to start over, but the
structure has been stable for a couple decades. It is what it is.

Finally, `perldoc` has been around for a couple of decades and has
encountered many insane situations in that time. There's a lot of
historical knowledge baked into that. We try to keep `perldoc` acting
just like it did in the past, when reasonable.

## Our intent

We try to respond to all issues in the same day, or as soon as I can.
Sometimes I'm off the grid. With that, we try to move the process forward
as much as I can or explain what's holding it up. We try to respond to
every issue as soon as we see it, even if that means our response is "We saw
your issue".

We use GitHub labels on issues to note what stage it is in. Each issue
or pull request should have a "Status: " label, a "Priority: ", and a
"Type: " label. Everything starts as "Priority: low", but that's just
an automatic thing. We'll adjust labels as necessary.

If you see the label "Status: stalled", that usually means there's
something we don't control that needs to happen for the issue to move forward.
That might mean the requestor needs to supply some details, respond to
change requests, or something else.

The "Status: Backlog" label means there's nothing blocking the issue,
but we've decided not to work on it immediately (although anyone can
decide to work on it). Usually this means that we have other development
we are prioritizing.

If you think that we have ignored your issue for too long, feel free
to ask about it's status. You might get the same answer back, but at
least you know we are alive.

## Reporting a bug

To report a bug, [use the bug template](https://github.com/briandfoy/pod-perldoc/issues/new/choose)
in GitHub. The issue template shows you what we would like to know.

If you don't want to use GitHub for whatever reason, send email to
briandfoy@pobox.com. There might be a significant delay in responding
to that.

There are several bits of information that can help us, and if you don't
provide it we will ask for it. You can put this inline with the text
or attach files. We'll figure it out.

* Your version of perldoc
* Your environment
* Your perl config
* A sample run under perldoc debugging

Show us your version of `perldoc`:

	$ perldoc -h

We also would like to see your perl config:

    $ perl -V

Here's a Perl one-liner to grab the environment values we care about
(there may be others):

    $ perl -le 'print qq($_: $ENV{$_}) for @ARGV' LANG LC_ALL LC_LANG LESS MANPAGER MANWIDTH MORE PAGER PERLDOC PERLDOC_PAGER PERLDOCDEBUG RTFREADER TERM

Run `perldoc` under debugging and include all the output:

	$ env PERLDOCDEBUG=5 perldoc -D ...

## Requesting a feature

All Pod formatting is handled by modules outside of the Pod::Perldoc
repo. If your feature is about formatting Pod, find the right translator
and work there.

If your feature is about the operation of `perldoc`, for example, a
new switch to search a particular page of the perl documentation, that's
something that we can consider. Here's some things to think about as
you prepare your proposal:

* what command-line switch do you want, and does that fit in with all of the other switches?
* which perl doc pages will perldoc need to examine?
* is it possible to isolate the parts of that page that you want to extract?
* how would you pass that extract to the Pod formatters so they know what to do?

## Sending a pull request

You can clone this repo and make a pull request in the usual GitHub
fashion. We don't have particular guidance on that at the moment beyond
the usual wisdom:

* ask about big changes before you do a lot of work.
* don't make unrelated changes in one pull request.
* follow the style in the file you edit. Some files use different styles (yeah, we know).
* everything has to work on Windows too.

If you do not want to make a pull request, you can send patch files
to briandfoy@pobox.com. These will be converted to pull requests. Note
if you want to mask your name or email address; otherwise we will use that
info for the git author and email.

## Testing

We want to be very careful about testing before we send out a stable
release:

* the Pod::Perldoc test suite must pass.
* all workflows must pass.
* the coverage of the test suite should not have decreased.
* all new features must be fully tested.
* we want to test against good and bad inputs.
* we must address all significant issues found by CPAN Testers.

At the moment, the Pod::Perldoc package has very limited testing. That's
something that we want to fix. In particular, we want to take known
Pod pages and translate them to see if the output changed.

There are various GitHub workflows that run the test suite, but there
could be more tests.

## Becoming a part of the team

I'm inclined to give collaborator status in the repo to people with a
track record of good development.
